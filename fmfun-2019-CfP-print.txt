-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The largest transformations that universities make to industrial
practices is through releasing legions of graduates every year. These
graduates challenge established processes, and pave ways for new
approaches. The standard CS graduate leaves university with either no
knowledge of Formal Methods or a hatred for Formal Methods. Unless this
situation is changed, Formal Methods will never be accepted in industry.

This workshop explores ways of how to utilize this pathway to
transformation for spreading Formal Methods. In current practice, FM
are often taught by theoreticians, who (ab)use their FM courses to teach
theoretical concepts rather than putting FMs in a SE context. The
workshop's vision is that FMs ought to be taught in such a way that
every student can have fun with it. But how can this be achieved?

In order to answer this question the workshop welcomes participants from
Formal methods as well as from education to exchange their views and
perspectives. We aim to formulate a joint white paper that collects the
outcomes of discussion and activities at the workshop. This white paper shall
be circulated to educational bodies in charge of giving recommendations on
curriculum development and will be published in the postproceedings.

TOPICS AND WORKSHOP FORMAT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The workshop invites contributions that address this question, which
include but are not limited to

  Experience reports by teachers and students;
  New teaching approaches, e.g. games;
  Education-oriented research or classroom experience ;
  Innovative teaching techniques or pedagogical tools ;
  Curricular innovations or initiatives;
  Innovative industry-education collaboration interventions;
  Didactics and methods of teaching and assessment;
  Combination of teaching and research;
  Post-hoc analysis of successes and failures in teaching and learning;
  Collaborative Learning;
  Technology transfer to industry;
  Developing student skills, e.g. on abstract thinking and logical reasoning;
  Comparison of formal methods from a teaching/learning perspective;
  Children education and formal methods;

for university and pre-university education.

The workshop will consist of contributed and invited talks, including
a living lab on teaching Formal Methods with Fun and facilitated discussions
Leading to the formulation of the white paper.
